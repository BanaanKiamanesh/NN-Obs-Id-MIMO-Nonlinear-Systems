# Neural Network Observer-Identifier for MIMO Nonlinear Systems

Implementation of a recurrent neural network based Observer/Identifier for highly Non-Linear Dynamical Systems, using the [Lorenz Attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) as a test case.

> ***Note:*** In this context, an observer uses system output as input to estimate states, whereas an identifier uses system states as input to estimate unknown dynamics.
